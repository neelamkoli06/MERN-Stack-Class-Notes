    <!-- hoisting
    
    we can delcared variable after used
    or
     we can used variable before delcartion

     Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

    <!-- var is hoisted -->

    <script>
        var name = "John";
        console.log(name);


        // skill = "ReactJS";
        // var skill;
        // console.log(skill);

        skill = "MERN STack";
        console.log(skill);
        var skill;


        // ******************************************************8

        // let const are not hoisted
        // Cannot access 'age' before initialization



        age = 23;
        console.log(age);
        let age;

    </script>

    <!-- 
The let and const Keywords
Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.

Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.

The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared: -->


<!-- **************************************************************** -->
<!-- 
    Declare Your Variables At the Top !
    Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior of JavaScript.

    If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs (errors).

    To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.

    Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good rule. -->
