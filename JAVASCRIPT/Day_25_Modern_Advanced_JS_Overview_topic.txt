event looping

JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.
 This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.

👉🏻Callback and callback hell
👉🏻solution for callback hell
👉🏻SetTimeout and promise which one executed first-

  than callstack queue

So Promises will executed first
