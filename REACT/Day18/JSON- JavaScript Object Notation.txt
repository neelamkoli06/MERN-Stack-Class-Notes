JSON- JavaScript Object Notation

format to store and transfer data

is Like a Object

JSON is a text
Most readable format

JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand


********************************************************************************************


Why Use JSON?
The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. 
Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.

Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.

2 Methods-

Converts a JavaScript value to a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) string.


JSON.stringify()



********************************************

HTTPS- SSL- Secure Socket Layer


What is HTTP?
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

Example: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client.
 The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.

HTTP Methods


CURD- Create Read Update Delete



GET
POST
PUT/PATCH
HEAD
DELETE
PATCH
OPTIONS
CONNECT
TRACE



*********************************************************
PUT VS PATCH method-


PUT -  Update entire resources with modifying entire data

PUT is used to replace the entire resource with a new representation, 
meaning that all the fields of the resource are sent in the request body, even if they are not modified.





Patch- Update Partial Resource without modifying entire data

PATCH is used to apply partial updates to a resource, meaning that 
only the fields that need to be changed are sent in the request body.

What is an API?
An API or Application Programming Interface is a facilitator that enables apps, databases, 
softwares and IoT devices to communicate with each other, without which they wonâ€™t be able to interact.
 It's a set of tools and protocols used by developers to build user-friendly software apps.

How does API Works

What is Web API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface.

A Web API is an application programming interface for the Web.

A Browser API can extend the functionality of a web browser.

A Server API can extend the functionality of a web server.

Just like a user interface (usually a graphical user interface or GUI) is built for humans to interact with applications, APIs are built for applications to interact with each other.

The application programming interface layer is responsible for data transfer and processing between a server and an application. APIs collate data from one application, format it for export, and transmit it to the destination application without compromising accuracy or security.

JSON Server Setup

1. Create Directory-  JSON_App
       
       create react app-npm init 
                        npx create-react-app my-app
                        cd my-app


2. setup JSON Server


 cd my-app   
 mkdir json_data
 cd json_data-  > npm i -g json-server@0



3. Creating JSON file and then Start JSON server

npx json-server --watch db.json


localhost:3000
